#  Exercise
## I took this old assignment and added gulp bootstrap sass
For this challenge, I want you to replace the employee Arrays inside of the 'three bugs' challenge with Objects. So replace this code:

```
var arrayAtticus = ["Atticus", "2405", "47000", 3];
var arrayJem = ["Jem", "62347", "63500", 4];
var arrayBoo = ["Boo", "11435", "54000", 3];
var arrayScout = ["Scout", "6243", "74750", 5];
```

With Objects instead of arrays. This also means that you will need to work through the rest of the code and write upgrades where needed.
